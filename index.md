`prestochango` is a JVM library for working with an archive of CITE Collections.

`prestochango` is used by the `hocuspocus` library to manage a CITE Collection archive, including representing an archive of local files as RDF, and by the `sparlqcc` library, including instantiating the results of SPARQL queries as `prestochango` objects.

Version numbers follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).  The 2.x series of releases is a ground-up rewrite with cleaner organization of fundamental objects in the library.  Version 2.0 introduces the basic objects; version 2.1 is planned to add serialization as RDF.
